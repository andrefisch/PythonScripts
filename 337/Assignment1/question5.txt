b) 	For a description of how to use a function in python, you type
	>>> help()
	at the prompt. That will bring you to interactive help mode at which
	point you can enter the module you want to know how to use
	>>> math
	and a list of functions in the module will be displayed.

a)	print r
	if n==r
	if n > r:
		break
	if n < 2:
		print "Better luck next time\n"
	LOOP BEGINS AGAIN

b)	print r
	if n==r:
		continue
	else:
		print "Wow, you are lucky\n"

c)	print r
	if n==r
	if n > r
	print "x"
	LOOP BEGINS AGAIN

d)	print r
	if n==r:
		continue
	LOOP BEGINS AGAIN

a) 	lst * 3 - This statement will extend the list by tripling it
	[7, 8, 9, 7, 8, 9, 7, 8, 9]
	[lst] * 3 - This statement will create a list of three lists
	each consisting of the original
	[[7, 8, 9], [7, 8, 9], [7, 8, 9]]

b)	arr is a 3x3 two-dimensional array with three references to lst
	which would make arr = [[7, 8, 9], [7, 8, 9], [7, 8, 9]].
	The command lst[1] = 7 will change the second element in the array
	referenced three times to a 7. So the end result of the four statements
	is [[7, 7, 9], [7, 7, 9], [7, 7, 9]]. If we change lst[1] = 7 to
	arr[1][1] = 7 the end result will be the same since we are still
	changing a spot in an array that has been referenced.

c)	Using slice to create arr instead of using a reference to lst three
	times would create a new array of [7, 8, 9] which is referenced by
	arr three times. So if you use arr[1][1] = 7 the end result will still
	be [[7, 7, 9], [7, 7, 9], [7, 7, 9]].

d)	In order to create arr so that changing [1][1] will not change
	[0][1] and [2][1] you need to create arr like this:
	arr = [[7, 8, 9], [7, 8, 9], [7, 8, 9]]

a)	The Python statement produces a list of numbers that a given number
	is divisible by.
